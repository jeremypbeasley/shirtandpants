# Shirt & Pants

My boilerplate for basic websites. You'll do fine now that you've at least got a shirt and pants.

I'm using `Bower` to manage libraries, `npm` to manage `Grunt`, and `Grunt` to compile `Stylus` and concatonate Javascript.

How can I use this?

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` and `bower install`.
3. Run `grunt`.
4. Have fun.
