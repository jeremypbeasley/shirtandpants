      <p><span class="PostDate">December 15, 2016 — </span> My dad worked harder than anyone I know. He set the bar and I credit him for much of what I consider to be my work ethic to be today. Beyond just working hard, he was constantly curious and full of projects. I remember a summer where he was building a Starbucks store, building a treehouse, sculpting a race track for our dirt bikes, remodeling our bathroom, and building a deck all at once. Never a dull moment.</p>
      <p>I get a kick out of making things - all kinds of things. I find my curiosity to be the biggest driving factor in the decisions I make as a creative person. My interest in film has been huge over the last couple years and it's driven me into yet another creative outlet beyond design and coding interactive experiences for screens.</p>
      <p>So here I am frustrated as hell on a Tuesday afternoon. I'm wondering why I'm left feeling so unsatisfied at work and every other venture of mine. Simply put: I'm doing too much. At this moment I'm leading the re-design and architecture of Starbucks.com, helping Canlis with a new website and creative strategy, directing and shooting a short documentary about a survivor of prostitution in Seattle, learning Node and two front end frameworks, studying cinematography, design and building a budgeting app with a few friends, and dabbling in getting into writing music again. All of this, of course, on top of raising three kids and spending ample time with the family exploring our new home in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.</p>
